I'm interested in building a sustainable future and decentralized web. I am a mission-driven creative problem solver. I live for designing customer-centric products experiences.

Better if it's homemade.\n- Running. \n- Electronic Dance Music (House and Techno). I'm currently listening to [Adra](https://adra.bandcamp.com/album/fear-is-the-mind-killer).\n- Surfing.
