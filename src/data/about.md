# Intro

I am a junior (year 4/5) computer science student at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/), Philadelphia, PA. I have one year of junior experience across my time at [Susquehanna International Group](https://sig.com/) and [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/) in both frontend and backend development.

I am a go-getter that enjoys problem solving and socializing with people. Most of all, I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how it can connect people.

# Currently

I just finished my second co-op at [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/) and am currently in classes. I will be embarking on my two tracks: artificial intelligence and computer vision. I am very relieved to be back in person again (but safety is always number one)!

# I like

- Chess
- First-person-shooter video games (e.g. Counter-Strike)
- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
- Pool (not the swimming one)
- Anime
- Ice skating
- Biking
- Photography
- Travelling

# Fun facts

- I learned to play chess all by myself and played nationally in the USCF from 2015-2017.
- I type very fast. I have an average WPM of 136, and my highest WPM is 163.
- I attended my first hackathon in 2019, but never presented (we all chickened!).
- I used to play the piano. I wish I continued playing because I find it fun now, but I definitely don't miss the practice sessions.
- I have a lot of side projects that have never survived and live in the dark corner called _private repos_.

# I dream of

- visiting all the continents (except Antarctica).
- speaking all languages.
- being better than you at Smash Ultimate.
- you not asking for example side projects because I am far too embarassed by their progress.
