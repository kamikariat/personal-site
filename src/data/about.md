I'm finishing up my last semester at UC Berkeley, majoring in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science.

Previously, I worked on Vehicle Infotainment Software at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), High Tech Manufacturing at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), Robotics Cloud Platform at [CloudMinds](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudminds-technologies/), and Low Band Communication System at Irvine Cubesat.
